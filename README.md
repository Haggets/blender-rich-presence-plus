# Blender Discord Rich Presence
Another Blender Rich Presence plugin that unlike the rest, gives you total control in terms of customization, being able to freely modify what to show, and when to show it

## Features

* Show the version Blender is currently on, custom text or nothing at all
* Show the name of the blend file, the full path of it, custom text or nothing at all
* Show the current workspace the user is on, show custom text, or nothing at all
* Filter out specific workspaces (Every workspace but the rendering workspace for example)
* Show the current state/mode the user is on (Object mode, Edit mode (Which includes every type of edit mode with their respective icon), sculpt mode...) or nothing at all
* Filter out specifc states/modes (Every state but object mode for example)
* Show the current render engine while rendering (Displayed right after the workspace text) or not
* Show elapsed time since you booted up Blender, or not
* Show elapsed time since you began a render (The prior time resumes itself after the render is over)
* Show an approximate time to when your render will end, or not

As you can see, i made this plugin with the intention of providing as much customizability as possible in case you need or want something different, so if you want as much or as little information as possible about your current Blender session, the plugin won't disappoint
